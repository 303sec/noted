Just hit with the need to add something to my methodolody:

https://ejj.io/misconfigured-cors/

The process for this should be:
0. Find resource
1. Either read resource or save for later
2. Run the command meth
3. Vim prompt for input, should take seconds to add
4. now item is stored in the database!

Retrival comes later in all honesty. Might as well just add stuff in bulk as I go along!
